Giter8 is a command line tool to generate files and directories from templates published on Github or any other git repository. It’s implemented in Scala and runs through the [sbt launcher](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) , but it can produce output for any purpose.





Starting sbt 0.13.13, Giter8 can be called from sbt’s["new" command](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-new-and-Templates.html)as follows:

```
$ sbt new eed3si9n/hello.g8
```
